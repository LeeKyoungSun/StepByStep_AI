Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
3RD EDITION
Kindergarten through 12th Grade
NATIONAL GUIDELINES TASK FORCE
Acknowledgements
For over a decade, SIECUS has published the Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: Kindergarten-12th Grade to help educators create new sexuality education programs and evaluate already existing curricula. The Guidelines, developed by a national task force of experts in the fields of adolescent development, health care, and education, provide a framework of the key concepts, topics, and messages that all sexuality education programs would ideally include.
This Third Edition of the Guidelines is based on the work of the original National Guidelines Task Force; the basic structure and content remain the same. Certain topics, messages, and age-levels, however, have been changed to reflect new information and the reality that today’s young people are facing. In addition, we have added a section on using the Guidelines that provides specific advice, ideas, and resources to help educators implement this important framework into their efforts to provide high-quality sexuality education to young people in their schools and communities.
Since they were originally developed 13 years ago, the Guidelines have become one of the most influential publications in the field and a trusted resource for educators, curriculum developers, and school administrators. SIECUS has distributed well over 100,000 copies of this publication. In fact, the Guidelines are downloaded from SIECUS’ website by more than 1,000 people each month.
Given how popular and valuable this publication is, undertaking this revision was at the same time exciting and daunting, and we have many people to thank for the success of the final product.
First we would like to thank the John M. Lloyd Foundation and Barbara Stanton whose generous support made it possible for SIECUS to produce this vital resource.
We must also thank all of the members of the original task force for the enormity of the task they took on. There is a phrase in the publishing world that asks “Where were you when the page was blank?” Having worked for over a year to update and revise the Guidelines, we cannot imagine the effort and patience it must have taken to start from scratch.
In addition, a number of former and present SIECUS staff members assisted us in updating messages and adding new information and ideas including Myra Batchelder, Kate McCarthy, Jason Osher, Ambika Panday, Coralie Meade Rodriguez, Darlene Torres, and Adrienne Verrilli. We give special thanks to Amy Levine who spent a great deal of time helping us perfect messages. We would also like to thank Joseph DiNoricia, Jr., SIECUS President and CEO, for his guidance and leadership on this project.
Finally, we must thank all of our reviewers. For this edition of the Guidelines, we assembled a panel of experts in the field to review the concepts, topics, and messages. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Nora Gelperin, Eva Goldfarb, Joan Helmich, Maureen Kelly, Lis Maurer, Elizabeth Schroeder, and Bill Yarber. Their comments and ideas were always insightful, often inspirational, and occasionally humorous. This revision would not have been possible without their input.
It is our sincere hope that this edition of the Guidelines is a valuable resource for educators and curriculum developers and that it ultimately helps to ensure that all young people receive the comprehensive education about sexuality they need to become sexually healthy adults.

Background and Introduction
exuality education is a lifelong process of acquiring information and forming attitudes, beliefs, and values about such important topics as identity, relationships, and intimacy. The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) believes that all people have the right to comprehensive sexuality education that addresses the socio-cultural, biological, psychological, and spiritual dimensions of sexuality by providing information; exploring feelings, values, and attitudes; and developing communication, decision-making, and critical-thinking skills.
While parents are – and ought to be – their children’s primary sexuality educators, they often need help and encouragement. Faith-based institutions, community-based organizations, and schools can play an important role.
SIECUS believes that comprehensive school-based sexuality education should be part of the education program at every grade. Such programs should be appropriate to the age, developmental level, and cultural background of students and respect the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community. Comprehensive school-based sexuality education complements and augments the sexuality education children receive from their families, religious and community groups, and health care professionals.
SIECUS is not alone in the belief that school-based sexuality education is vitally important to the health and well-being of our nation’s youth. National, state, and local polls have consistently found that a majority of parents want schools to provide comprehensive education about sexuality that includes such topics as abstinence, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), HIV/AIDS, contraception, and disease prevention methods.1 In fact, many states mandate that some or all of these topics are covered in school curricula.2 Research also supports a comprehensive approach to sexuality education with numerous studies finding that such programs can help young people delay intercourse, reduce the frequency of intercourse, reduce the number of sexual partners they have, and increase their use of condoms and other contraceptive methods when they do become sexual active.3
Educators and schools, however, are often left in the difficult position of trying to determine exactly what their sexuality education courses should look like with little or no guidance. For over a decade, SIECUS has published the Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: Kindergarten-12th Grade to provide such guidance and help educators create new sexuality education programs and evaluate existing curricula. The Guidelines, created by a national task force of experts in the fields of adolescent development, health care, and education, provide a framework of the key concepts, topics, and messages that all sexuality education programs would ideally include.
Background and Introduction • 13
History of the Guidelines
As the 1980s drew to a close, in part because of the rapidly growing AIDS pandemic, there was renewed interest in providing young people with the information and skills they needed to avoid unintended pregnancy and STDs. In fact, at that point, a number of states began to mandate that schools teach young people about STDs, HIV/AIDS, and other sexual health topics.
At the same time, however, debates were raging about whether young people should instead learn solely about abstinence, if certain controversial topics such as masturbation and abortion could be discussed in classrooms, and at what age other topics should be introduced.
This left many teachers confused and on their own. A 1989 study found that most sexuality education teachers created their own curricular material, often without guidance from the state or local school district.4 Other studies found that few of the teachers responsible for sexuality education had received formal training in the subject.5
SIECUS realized that ultimately it would be the young people who suffered the most because they would not receive the high-quality education they needed to become sexually healthy adults.
In 1990, SIECUS undertook a major effort to change this by convening the National Guidelines Task Force, a group of leading educators, health professionals, and representatives from national organizations who focused on adolescent development, education, and sexuality. Task force members included representatives from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Medical Association, the National School Boards Association, the National Education Association, the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, as well as schoolbased sexuality education teachers, national program developers, and experienced trainers.
These experts were charged with the difficult task of creating an ideal model of comprehensive sexuality education by developing a framework of the concepts, topics, skills, and messages young people should learn and determining the age-level at which each should be introduced.
In 1991, the task force released the Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education: Kindergarten-12th Grade. The Guidelines represented the first national model for comprehensive sexuality education and helped educators evaluate existing curricula and create new programs. Since they were first published, well over 100,000 copies have been distributed in both hard copy and electronic form. In addition, the Guidelines have been adapted and translated into Spanish for use in Latino communities in the U.S., and guidelines adaptation projects have produced national models in countries such as Brazil, India, Iceland, Nigeria, and Russia.
This Third Edition is based on the work of the original task force; the basic structure and content remain the same. Certain topics, messages, and age-levels, however, have been changed to reflect new information, ongoing community dialogue about the appropriate content of sexuality education, and the reality that today’s young people are facing.

Structure of the Guidelines
The Guidelines are modeled after the landmark School Health Education Study (SHES) published in the late 1960s. SHES developed an innovative approach to structuring health knowledge by identifying broad concepts and related subconcepts and then arranging these in a hierarchy for students in kindergarten through 12th grade.6
Using this model, the task force sought to create an organizational framework of the important knowledge and skills related to sexuality and family living. To do this, the task force first determined the life behaviors of a sexually healthy adult which serve as outcome measures of successful sexuality education. They then compiled the information and determined the skills necessary to achieve these life behaviors and organized them into key concepts, topics, subconcepts, and age-appropriate developmental messages.
Key Concepts: Key concepts are broad categories of information about sexuality and family living. The Guidelines are organized into six key concepts, each of which encompasses one essential area of learning for young people. They are:
Key Concept 1: Human Development. Human development is characterized by the interrelationship between physical, emotional, social, and intellectual growth.
Key Concept 2: Relationships. Relationships play a central role throughout our lives.
Key Concept 3: Personal Skills. Healthy sexuality requires the development and use of specific personal and interpersonal skills.
Key Concept 4: Sexual Behavior. Sexuality is a central part of being human, and individuals express their sexuality in a variety of ways.
Key Concept 5: Sexual Health. The promotion of sexual health requires specific information and attitudes to avoid unwanted consequences of sexual behavior.
Key Concept 6: Society and Culture. Social and cultural environments shape the way individuals learn about and express their sexuality.
Life Behaviors: Life behaviors are essentially outcomes of instruction. For each of the broad categories identified as a key concept, the Guidelines note several life behaviors of a sexually healthy adult that reflect actions students will be able to take after having applied the information and skills.
For example, life behaviors under Key Concept 3: Personal Skills, include: “Identify and live according to one’s values”; “Take responsibility for one’s own behavior”; and “Practice effective decision-making.” (A complete list of life behaviors appears on page 14.)
Topics: Topics are the individual subjects that need to be discussed in order to sufficiently address each key concept and help students achieve the desired outcomes or life behaviors. Each key concept is broken down into a number of component topics.
Background and Introduction • 15
Life Behaviors of a Sexually Healthy Adult
A sexually healthy adult will:
•	Appreciate one’s own body.
•	Seek further information about reproduction as needed.
•	Affirm that human development includes sexual development, which may or may not include reproduction or sexual experience.
•	Interact with all genders in respectful and appropriate ways.
•	Affirm one’s own sexual orientation and respect the sexual orientations of others.
•	Affirm one’s own gender identities and respect the gender identities of others.
•	Express love and intimacy in appropriate ways.
•	Develop and maintain meaningful relationships.
•	Avoid exploitative or manipulative relationships.
•	Make informed choices about family options and relationships.
•	Exhibit skills that enhance personal relationships.
•	Identify and live according to one’s own values.
•	Take responsibility for one’s own behavior.
•	Practice effective decision-making.
•	Develop critical-thinking skills.
•	Communicate effectively with family, peers, and romantic partners.
•	Enjoy and express one’s sexuality throughout life.
•	Express one’s sexuality in ways that are congruent with one’s values.
•	Enjoy sexual feelings without necessarily acting on them.
For example, Key Concept 2: Relationships, includes the following topics: families, friendship, love, romantic relationships and dating, marriage and lifetime commitments, and raising children. Together, the key concepts and topics create a simple outline for comprehensive sexuality education programs. (A complete list of Key Concepts and Topics appears on page 16.)
Subconcepts: Subconcepts represent the essential message that young people need to learn about each topic. The Guidelines begin the discussion on each topic by identifying a subconcept that directly relates to the desired life behaviors.
For example, within Key Concept 1: Human Development, Topic 4 is Body Image. The subconcept suggests that students learn that “People’s images of their bodies affect their feelings and behaviors.” Subconcepts appear throughout the Guidelines.
16 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
•	Discriminate between life-enhancing sexual behaviors and those that are harmful to self and/or others.
•	Express one’s sexuality while respecting the rights of others.
•	Seek new information to enhance one’s sexuality.
•	Engage in sexual relationships that are consensual, non-exploitative, honest, pleasurable, and protected.
•	Practice health-promoting behaviors, such as regular check-ups, breast and testicular self-exam, and early identification of potential problems.
•	Use contraception effectively to avoid unintended pregnancy.
•	Avoid contracting or transmitting a sexually transmitted disease, including HIV.
•	Act consistently with one’s own values when dealing with an unintended pregnancy.
•	Seek early prenatal care.
•	Help prevent sexual abuse.
•	Demonstrate respect for people with different sexual values.
•	Exercise democratic responsibility to influence legislation dealing with sexual issues.
•	Assess the impact of family, cultural, media, and societal messages on one’s thoughts, feelings, values, and behaviors related to sexuality.
•	Critically examine the world around them for biases based on gender, sexual orientation, culture, ethnicity, and race.
•	Promote the rights of all people to accurate sexuality information.
•	Avoid behaviors that exhibit prejudice and bigotry.
•	Reject stereotypes about the sexuality of different populations.
•	Educate others about sexuality.
Developmental Messages: Developmental messages are brief statements that contain the specific information young people need to learn about each topic. For each topic, the Guidelines present developmental messages appropriate for four separate age levels which reflect stages of development. The levels are:
Level 1: middle childhood, ages 5 through 8; early elementary school
Level 2: preadolescence, ages 9 through 12; later elementary school
Level 3: early adolescence, ages 12 through 15; middle school/junior high school
Level 4: adolescences, ages 15 through 18; high school
For example, within Key Concept 6: Society and Culture, Topic 5 is Diversity. Developmental messages about diversity for Level 1 include: “Individuals differ in the way they think, act, look, and live,” and “Talking about differences helps people understand each other better.” In contrast, developmental
Background and Introduction • 17
messages for Level 4 include: “Confronting one’s own biases and prejudices can be difficult,” and “Workplaces benefit from having employees from diverse backgrounds.”
The developmental messages are introduced at the level when they should first be discussed. A message introduced in Level 1 will not be listed again. This does not mean, however, that educators working with older students should not reintroduce or reinforce earlier messages. All developmental messages should be repeatedly reinforced at different age levels. In addition, in programs or communities where sexuality education does not start until middle school or junior high school (Level 3), it may first be necessary to introduce students to the developmental messages suggested in earlier levels.
It is also important to note that while the developmental messages contain the age-appropriate information that young people need to learn, they are not meant to simply be read or quoted verbatim in materials or activities. Instead, they are intended for educators and other adults who are in a better position to understand the best language and methods to use when sharing this information with young people.

18 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Goals, Values, and Fundamental Principles
Although the Guidelines are designed to be adaptable to the needs and beliefs of different communities, they are nonetheless based on certain specific values relating to sexuality and the nature of ideal sexuality education. Before developing the concepts and messages in the Guidelines, the National Guidelines Task Force agreed upon the goals of sexuality education, the values inherent in the Guidelines, and a number of fundamental principles about the implementation of sexuality education.
The Goals of Sexuality Education The primary goal of sexuality education is to promote adult sexual health. It should assist young people in developing a positive view of sexuality, provide them with information they need to take care of their sexual health, and help them acquire skills to make decisions now and in the future. The Guidelines recognize that the goals of sexuality education fall into four areas:
Information: Sexuality education seeks to provide accurate information about human sexuality, including growth and development, human reproduction, anatomy, physiology, masturbation, family life, pregnancy, childbirth, parenthood, sexual response, sexual orientation, gender identity, contraception, abortion, sexual abuse, HIV/AIDS, and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Attitudes, Values, and Insights: Sexuality education seeks to provide an opportunity for young people to question, explore, and assess their own and their community’s attitudes about society, gender, and sexuality. This can help young people understand their family’s values, develop their own values, improve critical-thinking skills, increase self-esteem and self-efficacy, and develop insights concerning relationships with family members, individuals of all genders, sexual partners, and society at large. Sexuality education can help young people understand their obligations and responsibilities to their families and society.
Relationships and Interpersonal Skills: Sexuality education seeks to help young people develop interpersonal skills, including communication, decision-making, assertiveness, and peer refusal skills, as well as the ability to create reciprocal and satisfying relationships. Sexuality education programs should prepare students to understand sexuality effectively and creatively in adult roles. This includes helping young people develop the capacity for caring, supportive, non-coercive, and mutually pleasurable intimate and sexual relationships.
Responsibility: Sexuality education seeks to help young people exercise responsibility regarding sexual relationships by addressing such issues as abstinence, how to resist pressures to become involved in unwanted or early sexual intercourse, and the use of contraception and other sexual health measures.
Background and Introduction • 19
Values Inherent in the Guidelines The Guidelines are based on a number of values about sexuality, young people, and the role of families. While these values reflect those of many communities across the country, they are not universal. Parents, educators, and community members will need to review these values to be sure that the program that is implemented is consistent with their community’s beliefs, culture, and social norms. The values inherent in the Guidelines are:
•	Every person has dignity and self worth.
•	All children should be loved and cared for.
•	Young people should view themselves as unique and worthwhile individuals within the context of their cultural heritage.
•	Sexuality is a natural and healthy part of living.
•	All persons are sexual.
•	Sexuality includes physical, ethical, social, spiritual, psychological, and emotional dimensions.
•	Individuals can express their sexuality in varied ways.
•	Parents should be the primary sexuality educators of their children.
•	Families should provide children’s first education about sexuality.
•	Families should share their values about sexuality with their children.
•	In a pluralistic society, people should respect and accept the diversity of values and beliefs about sexuality that exist in a community.
•	Sexual relationships should be reciprocal, based on respect, and should never be coercive or exploitative.
•	All persons have the right and obligation to make responsible sexual choices.
•	Individuals, families, and society benefit when children are able to discuss sexuality with their parents and/or trusted adults.
•	Young people develop their values about sexuality as part of becoming adults.
•	Young people explore their sexuality as a natural process in achieving sexual maturity.
•	Early involvement in sexual behaviors poses risks.
•	Abstaining from sexual intercourse is the most effective method of preventing pregnancy and STD/HIV.
•	Young people who are involved in sexual relationships need access to information about healthcare services.
20 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Fundamental Principles While the Guidelines were created to be adaptable to a wide variety of communities and settings, they are based on a number of fundamental principles about the nature of ideal sexuality education programs. The task force believed that sexuality education programs benefit from:
Being Part of a Comprehensive Health Education Program: Sexuality education should be offered as part of an overall comprehensive health education program. Sexuality education can best address the broadest range of issues in the context of health promotion, social and gender equality, and disease prevention. Communities and schools should seek to integrate the concepts and messages in the Guidelines into their overall health education initiatives.
Well-Trained Teachers: Sexuality education should be taught by specially trained teachers. Professionals responsible for sexuality education must receive training in human sexuality, including the philosophy and methodology of sexuality education. While ideally teachers should attend academic courses or programs in schools of higher education, in-service courses, continuing education classes, and intensive seminars can also help prepare sexuality educators.
Community Involvement: The community must be involved in the development and implementation of sexuality education programs. School-based programs must be carefully developed to respect the diversity of values and beliefs represented in the community.
Parents, family members, teachers, administrators, community and religious leaders, and students should all be involved.
A Focus on All Youth: All children and youth will benefit from comprehensive sexuality education regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socio-economic status, or disability. Programs and materials should be adapted to reflect the specific issues and concerns of the community as well as any special needs of the learners. In addition, curricula and material should reflect the cultural diversity represented in the classroom.
A Variety of Teaching Methods: Sexuality education is most effective when young people not only receive information but are also given the opportunity to explore their own and society’s attitudes and values and to develop or strengthen social skills. A wide variety of teaching methods and activities can foster learning such as interactive discussions, role plays, demonstrations, individual and group research, group exercises, and homework assignments.
The Guidelines are a valuable tool for educators and community members wishing to develop and analyze sexuality education programs, curricula, and textbooks. It cannot be said often enough, however, that the Guidelines are not a curriculum nor are they lesson plans. They are designed as a starting point for teachers and curriculum designers and can be used by local communities to plan new programs, evaluate existing curricula, train teachers, educate parents, conduct research, and write new materials. Ultimately, however, the community and school must determine which topics and developmental messages will be included and the lessons plans and formats that will be utilized.

Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Key Concept 1:
Human Development
Human development is characterized by the interrelationship between physical, emotional, social, and intellectual growth.
Human Development Life Behaviors:
Having applied the human development subconcepts at the appropriate age, the learner will be able to:
•	Appreciate one’s own body.
•	Seek further information about reproduction as needed.
•	Affirm that human development includes sexual development, which may or may not include reproduction or sexual experience.
•	Interact with all genders in respectful and appropriate ways.

Level 1 middle childhood, ages 5 through 8; early elementary school
Level 2 preadolescence, ages 9 through 12; upper elementary school
Level 3 early adolescence, ages 12 through 15; middle school/ junior high school
Level 4 adolescence, ages 15 through 18; high school
24 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Developmental Messages:
Level 1
•	Each body part has a correct name and a specific function.
•	A person’s genitals, reproductive organs, and genes determine whether the person is male or female.
•	A boy/man has nipples, a penis, a scrotum, and testicles.
•	A girl/woman has breasts, nipples, a vulva, a clitoris, a vagina, a uterus, and ovaries.
•	Some sexual or reproductive organs, such as penises and vulvas, are external or on the outside of the body while others, such as ovaries and testicles, are internal or inside the body.
•	Both boys and girls have body parts that feel good when touched.
Level 2
•	During puberty, internal and external sexual and reproductive organs mature in preparation for adulthood.
•	A young man’s ability to reproduce starts when he begins to produce sperm.
•	A young woman’s ability to reproduce starts when she begins to menstruate.
Level 3
•	The sexual response system differs from the reproductive system.
•	Some sexual and reproductive organs provide pleasure.
Level 4
•	Sexual differentiation, whether a fetus will be male or female, is determined largely by chromosomes and occurs early in prenatal development.
•	Some babies are born intersexed which means that they may have ambiguous genitals that are not clearly male or female and/or that their chromosomes do not match their genitals.
•	Hormones influence growth and development as well as sexual and reproductive functions.
•	A woman’s ability to reproduce ceases after menopause; after puberty, a man can usually reproduce for the rest of his life.
•	Individuals may want to use a mirror to look closely at their external organs so they can note any changes that may indicate health problems.
Topic 2: Puberty
Subconcept: Puberty is a universally experienced transition from childhood to adulthood that is characterized by physical and emotional changes.
Key Concept 1: Human Development • 25
Developmental Messages:
Level 1
•	Bodies change as children grow older.
•	Puberty is a time of physical and emotional change that happens as children become teenagers.
•	People are able to have children only after they have reached puberty.
Level 2
•	Puberty begins and ends at different ages for different people.
•	Everybody’s body changes at its own pace.
•	Some people will not complete puberty until their middle or late teens.
•	Girls often begin pubertal changes before boys.
•	Most changes in puberty, such as the growth of body hair and an increase in body odor, are similar for boys and girls.
•	The sexual and reproductive systems mature during puberty.
•	During puberty, girls begin to ovulate and menstruate, and boys begin to produce sperm and ejaculate – once this occurs girls are physically capable of becoming pregnant and boys of getting a female pregnant.
•	During puberty, some boys may ejaculate while they are asleep which is called a nocturnal emission or “wet dream.”
•	During puberty, emotional changes occur as a result of increased hormones.
•	During puberty, many people begin to develop sexual and romantic feelings.
•	Young teenagers sometimes feel uncomfortable, clumsy, and/or self-conscious because of the rapid changes in their bodies.
Topic 3: Reproduction
Subconcept: Most people have the capability to reproduce; people also have the ability to choose whether or not they wish to reproduce.
Developmental Messages:
Level 1
•	Men and women have reproductive organs that enable them to have a child.
•	Men and women have specific cells in their bodies (sperm cells and egg cells) that enable them to reproduce.
•	Reproduction requires that a sperm and egg join.
•	Vaginal intercourse – when a penis is placed inside a vagina – is the most common way for a sperm and egg to join.
26 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
•	When a woman is pregnant, the fetus grows inside her body in her uterus.
•	A woman can be pregnant with more than one fetus at a time.
•	Babies usually come out of a woman’s body through an opening called a vagina.
•	Some babies are born by an operation called a Caesarian Section.
•	A woman’s breasts can provide milk for a baby.
•	Not all men and women have children.
•	People who cannot have children may choose to adopt.
Level 2
•	Decisions about having children are based on personal values, cultural beliefs, and other factors.
•	Whenever vaginal intercourse occurs, it is possible for a woman to become pregnant.
•	The union of a sperm and an egg is called conception or fertilization.
•	The fetus begins to develop at fertilization.
•	The fetus develops during pregnancy, a 40-week cycle that ends with birth.
•	Sperm determine the biological sex of the fetus.
•	Contraception can prevent fertilization and/or pregnancy.
Level 3
•	People should use contraception during vaginal intercourse unless they want to have a child.
•	Conception can occur once a woman has ovulated (released an egg).
•	Ovulation is most likely to occur two weeks before a woman’s menstrual period.
•	Predicting ovulation accurately can be difficult.
•	A common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period.
•	Sexual intercourse during pregnancy usually will not harm the developing fetus.
Level 4

Using the
Guidelines
he Guidelines were designed as a framework for comprehensive sexuality education; as such, they can be used to create new programs or evaluate existing curricula and material. SIECUS believes that the Guidelines are an excellent starting point for both experienced sexuality education teachers and educators new to this topic. The following section is designed to give educators additional information, ideas, and encouragement for turning the Guidelines into a high-quality, comprehensive sexuality education program for young people in their school or community.
Prioritizing Topics
The task force designed the Guidelines to include all of the concepts and topics that young people need to learn in order to become sexually healthy adults. Ideally, all sexuality education programs would cover all of the concepts, topics, and developmental messages included in the Guidelines. SIECUS realizes, however, that due to constraints on time, staff, and other resources, many programs will not be able to tackle every topic in the Guidelines.
Educators and curriculum developers who find themselves in this position may need to start by choosing the topics they will cover. Decisions about topics are most often based on the amount of time and resources that can be devoted to a program as well as the needs of the young people involved.
Educators can use the key concepts and topics as a jumping off point and then work with staff, parents, and/or young people to narrow down and prioritize this list. Many educators prioritize topics based on their personal observations of the needs of the young people they work with. For example, after hearing young people spread misinformation about reproduction or demonstrate a lack of information about anatomy, an educator may choose to focus a program or lesson on Key Concept 1: Human Development. It can also be helpful to ask young people directly for their input in determining which topics will be covered.
The following exercise is designed to be conducted in a group setting—with educators, administrators, parents, or young people. Whether educators are evaluating an existing curriculum or creating a new one, this exercise can help them choose topics and determine priorities.
Using the Guidelines • 81
Prioritizing Topics Activity
On a sheet of paper, the facilitator should list all 39 topics suggested in the Guidelines, with a blank space in front of each for a score. Make one copy of this sheet for each participant and save one sheet to tally the final scores at the end of the activity. Also recreate this list on a large piece of newsprint so the whole group can view the final results.
Give each person a sheet with the 39 topics and explain that each individual has 15 points that he/she can assign to the topics listed. They can assign the points any way they want—i.e., he/she can give one topic 15 points, 15 topics one point each, or three topics five points each—however, no one can exceed 15 points total. Explain that ultimately the topics that get the most points will be considered the top priorities.
After giving each person 5–7 minutes to decide on their totals, have them share their score sheets with the whole group. Ask people to explain why they distributed their points in the way that they did. As each person presents, the facilitator should keep a tally of how the points are distributed and note the similarities and differences in the scores given.
After all the participants have shared their individual scores and the results have been tallied, note which topics received the highest scores. These are the ones the whole group has decided are most important. Allow the group an opportunity to negotiate and reprioritize based on the discussion.
Filling in the Gaps
While the Guidelines contain the key concepts, topics, and messages for a comprehensive program, they are not a curriculum; therefore, specific information is often left out. For example, the Guidelines suggest that students in early elementary school learn that “Each body part has a correct name and a specific function,” and that “A girl/woman has breasts, nipples, a vulva, a clitoris, a vagina, a uterus, and ovaries.” They do not, however, explain the specific function of each of these parts to students or educators. It is the responsibility of educators to fill in this information when necessary.
Whether educators are using the Guidelines to evaluate existing curricula or create new materials, it is important to have basic, accurate information about sexuality. Such background information can help individuals determine if the curriculum they are reviewing contains accurate, unbiased information and can be an essential base for any lessons that are developed. Numerous books and other resources are available to help educators review basic information and share it with young people.
82 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Resource Manuals
There are a number of books and manuals that can serve as excellent reference sources for educators to review basic information, confirm facts or figures, and seek answers to questions they may have. Educators may want to invest in a college-level human sexuality textbook, many of which provide introductory information in a straightforward manner and can serve as a valuable resource for both new and experienced teachers. Educators may also be interested in reference manuals that provide more in-depth information on specific topics such as women’s health or contraception. Some available textbooks and resource manuals include:
•	Exploring the Dimensions of Human Sexuality, by Jerrold S. Greenberg, Clint E. Bruess, and Debra Haffner; Jones and Bartlett; 40 Tall Pine Drive, Sudbury, MA, 01776; 978/443-5000; www.jbpub.com.

For additional resources see SIECUS’ Annotated Bibliography: Resources for Professionals (available online at www.siecus.org) or contact SIECUS’ Mary S. Calderone Library at 212/819-9770.
Websites
The Internet can also be a valuable source of basic information and statistics on such topics as contraceptive methods, STDs, and HIV. Scientific information and statistics on these topics frequently change and educators will need to continually update their information. Websites can be particularly useful on such topics as they are reviewed and revised more often than printed publications. At the same time, there is a great deal of inaccurate and biased information available on the Internet and it is important to use only reliable sources. Some reliable websites include:
STDs
•	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Sexually Transmitted Diseases www.cdc.gov/std
•	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Prevention Information Network, a service of the CDC National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention www.cdcnpin.org

Books for Young People
While the Guidelines present age-appropriate messages, these are not meant to be read verbatim or incorporated into lesson plans word-for-word. One of the challenges for educators may be determining the best language to use when presenting information to students. Numerous books have been developed for young people of various ages that explain many of the topics recommended in the Guidelines including puberty, relationships, sexual orientation, and contraception. Educators may find that such books help them develop the most appropriate and effective language for their students. Some available books for young people include:

84 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Community Information
The Guidelines include a number of messages that are meant to be customized for individual schools and communities such as “This school’s sexual harassment policy is ____________,” and “Most
communities have a telephone crisis line so people can talk to someone about a problem; the local crisis line phone number is _________________.”
These messages are especially important in helping young people identify resources and access available services in their community. Educators may want to complete these messages for their community before a course begins or use these messages as a launching point for a research project in which students investigate the available resources and services.
Teaching Methods
SIECUS believes that sexuality education is best taught using a variety of teaching methods that allow students to gain knowledge, acquire skills, and explore their values. The Guidelines, however, do not recommend teaching methods or provide ideas on matching available techniques with topics. Whether educators are creating their own program or evaluating existing materials, familiarity with a wide variety of methods for teaching about sexuality can be helpful. Some available resources on teaching methods include:
•	Teaching About Sexuality and HIV: Principles and Methods for Effective Education, by Evonne Hedgepeth and Joan Helmich; New York University Press; Washington Square, New York, NY 10003; 212/998-2575, www.nyupress.edu.

Using the Guidelines • 85
Evaluating Existing Curricula and Lessons
Many sexuality education resources already exist, from complete pre-packaged curricula, to lesson plans that cover one topic, to time-tested activities that have been frequently used with young people, to videos and other classroom materials.
More often than not, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. Sexuality education professionals have already created activities on almost every sexuality-related topic and these lessons can be easily modified and adapted to fit a variety of settings and age-groups.
Not all lesson plans or curricula, however, are created equal. Educators need to review all materials closely to ensure that the important topics and concepts are covered, that the information is accurate and age-appropriate, and that the resource does not rely on fear or shame. In addition, educators will want to look at whether a wide variety of teaching strategies are employed, whether the curriculum is culturally appropriate, and whether it encourages parental involvement. Finally, educators will want to make sure that the curriculum or lessons plans are based on theories and techniques that have been proven effective.
These simple questions, based on the Guidelines and available research, are a great place to begin.
Reviewing Topics and Messages
The Guidelines can help educators evaluate curriculum or lesson plans by providing a framework of suggested concepts, topics, and messages.
•	Which of the six key concepts does this curriculum/lesson address?
•	Which topics suggested for these key concepts are	included?
•	Which topics suggested for these key concepts are	not included?
•	Are the messages included in the curriculum/lesson	similar to those suggested by	the	Guidelines?
•	Are the messages included in the curriculum/lesson	age-appropriate	according to	the	Guidelines?
•	Are there important key concepts, topics, or messages suggested in the Guidelines that have been left out?
Ensuring Skills Are Addressed
In addition to providing information, the best curriculum and lessons on sexuality provide young people with opportunities to learn and practice a number of important skills.
•	Does the curriculum/lesson help young people build self-esteem?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson help young people identify other sources of information/help?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson help young people learn critical analysis skills?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson help young people identify risk factors?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson help young people practice decision-making and negotiation skills?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson help young people practice communication skills?
86 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Checking Accuracy and Appropriateness
It is also important to make sure that the information included in the curriculum/lesson is accurate, up-to-date, and appropriate for the students in the program.
•	Is the information in the curriculum/lesson scientifically and medically accurate?
•	Is the information up-to-date?
•	Is the information presented in a way that is appealing to young people?
•	Is the curriculum/lesson, including graphics, materials, and examples, culturally appropriate for the age, race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation of all the young people in the program?
Weeding Out Fear and Shame
Some sexuality education curricula and lessons rely on messages of fear and shame to try to control young people’s sexual behavior. There is no evidence that using fear will help young people delay sexual activity, and such messages may negatively affect their views on sexuality. These questions can help educators identify and avoid fear-based materials.
•	Does the curriculum/lesson indicate that pre-marital sexual behavior inevitably leads to pregnancy, STDs, guilt, bad relationships, or other negative consequences?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson portray students who have engaged in sexual behavior as troubled or less worthy of respect?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson portray sexuality/sexual behaviors as a force that young people cannot control?
•	Does the curriculum/lesson assert that STDs and unintended pregnancy are never an issue for married people?
But Does It Work?
As with any education program, it is important to continually assess whether a program is successful. Research has shown that programs that teach young people about both abstinence and other pregnancy and disease prevention methods can help young people delay intercourse, reduce the frequency of intercourse, reduce the number of partners they have, and increase condom and contraceptive use among sexually active teens. Although the types of programs that have been found to be effective vary, noted researcher Doug Kirby has identified 10 characteristics that these programs have in common.7 Educators evaluating curricula or lesson plans may want to keep these in mind as well.
Effective programs:
•	Focus on reducing one or more sexual behaviors that lead to unintended pregnancy or HIV/STD infection.
•	Are based on theoretical approaches that have been demonstrated to influence other health-related behavior and identify specific important sexual antecedents to be targeted.
•	Deliver and consistently reinforce a clear message about abstaining from sexual activity and/or using condoms or other forms of contraception. This appears to be one of the most important characteristics that distinguish effective from ineffective programs.
•	Provide basic, accurate information about the risks of teen sexual activity and about ways to avoid intercourse or use methods of protection against pregnancy and STDs.
Using the Guidelines • 87
•	Include activities that address social pressures that influence sexual behavior.
•	Provide examples of and practice with communication, negotiation, and refusal skills.
•	Employ teaching methods designed to involve participants and have them personalize the information.
•	Incorporate behavioral goals, teaching methods, and materials that are appropriate to the age, sexual experience, and culture of the students.
•	Last a sufficient length of time (i.e., more than a few hours).
•	Select teachers or peer leaders who believe in the program, and provide them with adequate training.
There are many existing curricula and compilations of lesson plans that meet the criteria set forth above. It is often just a matter of matching the right curriculum to the students and the program.
For a list of available sexuality education curricula and lesson plans see SIECUS’ Annotated Bibliography: Sexuality Education Curricula or contact SIECUS’ Mary S. Calderone Library at 212/819-9770.

CURRICULUM EVALUATION TOOL
Often, educators or curriculum review committees are charged with evaluating extensive programs or comparing the strengths and weaknesses of a number of available curricula. These individuals may need to examine each curriculum in greater detail. To help them with this sometimes daunting task, SIECUS has created the following evaluation tool based on the Guidelines that may be photocopied and filled in as a curriculum is read and discussed.

STDs/HIV CHECKLIST
It may also be helpful for educators to create simple evaluation tools or checklists to review lessons on specific topics that they have chosen to cover. Checklists can be based on subconcepts and developmental messages in the Guidelines as well as additional information that educators have found in their research.
The following is a checklist on STDs/HIV. It is adapted from a larger checklist created by William Yarber to help educators and school officials evaluate their existing STD/HIV prevention programs or create new curricula and materials on the topic. Dr. Yarber is a professor of Applied Health Science at Indiana University and the senior director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention. Dr. Yarber was also a member of the National Guidelines Task Force.
The checklist includes essential topics for STD/HIV prevention curricula and provides a basic concept for each topic. Specific developmental messages are not included. It is based on the Guidelines as well as other research on STDs/HIV. Educators evaluating STD/HIV prevention curricula can use this checklist along with the messages in the Guidelines to ensure that programs their community is using or considering are complete and accurate.
The STD/HIV Problem
□	The “Hidden” STD Epidemic
Although STDs are the most commonly reported infection disease in the United States, they are often hidden and the prevalence underestimated which can cause negative outcomes for individuals and society.
□	STDs
There are over 25 STDs, including HIV/AIDS, many of which have a particular impact on teenagers.
□	Size of Problem
STDs are prevalent in both the United States and around the world.
□	People with STDs/HIV
STD infections occur in all communities and population groups although individuals in underserved communities and communities of color are disproportionately affected by STDs and HIV.
□	Problems Caused by STDs/HIV
STDs/HIV impact lives and relationships, finances, research and healthcare priorities, and prevention efforts.
□	Reasons for the STD/HIV Epidemics
The STD/HIV epidemics are exacerbated by inadequate education, health care, and support, as well as social, economic, and emotional barriers that prevent some people from getting treatment.
96 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
Transmission of STDs/HIV
□	STD Organisms
STDs/HIV are usually found in body fluids and individuals can have more than one STD infection at a time.
□	Sexual Transmission of STDs/HIV
STDs/HIV are contracted during contact with an infected person; vaginal, anal, and oral sex all involve risk.
□	Sexual Relationships
Partner choice can increase risk for STDs/HIV.
□	Blood Transmission of STDs/HIV
Blood-to-blood transmission is the second-most common way STDs/HIV are contracted and people who share needles, people who have their bodies tattooed or pierced, and healthcare workers are at increased risk.
□	Mother-to-Child Transmission
STDs/HIV are sometimes passed from mother to child during pregnancy or breast-feeding but medical treatment is available to reduce a child’s risk of contracting STDs/HIV from his/her mother.
□	Increased HIV Risk with STD Infection
People with an STD are at increased risk of contracting HIV and people with HIV and an STD are at increased risk of transmitting HIV.
□	STD Transmission without Sex or Injection Drug Use
STDs/HIV are not transmitted through casual non-sexual contact.
STD/HIV Prevention
□	Sexual Abstinence
While sexual feelings are natural, there are benefits to sexual abstinence and delaying sexual intercourse.
□	Mutual Sexual Exclusivity
There are benefits to mutual sexual exclusivity; exclusive relationships other than marriage exist.
□	Condom Use
Condoms can be effective in preventing the spread of STDs/HIV; individuals should learn when and how to use condoms.
□	Careful Partner Selection
Carefully selecting partners can help individuals avoid sexual contact with people who might be at high risk for STDs/HIV.
Using the Guidelines • 97
□	Avoid Injection and Other Drugs
Injection drug use involves risk for STDs/HIV; individuals can identify and resist the pressure to use drugs.
□	Vaccines
Hepatitis B is the only STD with a vaccine but efforts are underway to create vaccines for HIV and Human Papilloma Virus.
□	Other Prevention Methods
There are many things individuals can do to help prevent the transmission of STDs/HIV including engaging in lower risk behaviors; avoiding contact with blood, semen, or vaginal fluids; and seeking appropriate prenatal care.
□	Communicating Prevention to Others
Communication is a valuable and necessary component of prevention and individuals can suggest ways to improve communication about sexuality-related issues.
□	Choosing Friends Wisely
Friends who support preventive and risk-reduction behaviors are important.
□	Help Avoiding STDs/HIV
Individuals need to know who might help them avoid STDs/HIV; teenagers may want to talk with their parents or other supportive adults about sexuality, growing up, and STD/HIV prevention.
□	Taking Responsibility for Personal Health and the Health of Others
Individuals can make efforts to control the spread of STDs/HIV by serving as responsible role models, accurate sources of information, and supportive friends.
RECOGNIZING STDs/HIV
□	STD/HIV Symptoms
STDs/HIV may have no symptoms or may have symptoms similar to those of other infections; individuals can become alert to the symptoms of STDs/HIV and seek prompt medical attention if they suspect they may be infected.
□	What to Do After Suspecting an STD/HIV
Individuals who suspect STD/HIV symptoms can stop having sexual contact, stop using and sharing needles, seek prompt medical attention, and encourage partners to seek testing and treatment as well.
SEEKING STD/HIV TESTS AND TREATMENT
□	STD/HIV Tests and Counseling
People who have practiced any STD/HIV risk behaviors may want to seek STD/HIV counseling/testing.
98 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
□	Confidential Testing and Treatment of Minors
Young people facing health issues may want to talk to parents or other trusted adults, but can often receive testing and treatment without parental consent.
□	The Medical Visit
Many different types of testing and treatment exist; individuals should talk to their healthcare provider about what is best for them.
□	STD/HIV Treatment
Although some STDs, such as HIV, have no cure, a number of STD treatments exist.
□	Support for People with STDs/HIV
Individuals who are infected with an STD/HIV need the support of family and friends and may also be able to find support groups or other resources that can help.
PARTNER STD/HIV TESTING AND TREATMENT
□	Importance of Asking Partner to See a Health Care Provider
Encouraging a partner to seek testing and treatment can protect his/her health, prevent reinfection, and reduce the spread of STDs/HIV.
□	Ways of Getting Partners to Testing and Treatment
Public health professionals and healthcare providers can help individuals determine the best way to approach their partner(s) about the need for testing and treatment.

Using the Guidelines • 99
Creating New Curricula and Lessons
Some educators or curriculum developers may prefer to create there own curricula or lessons. The Guidelines can help them do this as well. The first task is determining what topics the program will address based on the needs of the students and the available time, staff, and resources. (See the Prioritizing Topics section on page 79 for specific ideas on how to do this.)
The number of topics selected as well as the number of sessions and amount of time available will determine how many lessons educators or curriculum developers will need to create. It is important to remember that students can only absorb a limited amount of information in any given session; trying to cram too many topics into one session is not effective.
Goals and Learning Objectives
The next step is to develop goals and learning objectives for each lesson that is planned. Goals provide a framework for the topic and the general direction for the lesson. Goals describe what the lesson will teach about, explain, discuss, or demonstrate. The subconcepts listed for each topic in the Guidelines can serve as starting point for developing goals. For example, in Key Concept 3: Personal Skills, Topic 4 is Assertiveness. An educator creating a lesson plan on assertiveness may decide that his/her goal is to explore assertiveness and teach that “assertiveness is communicating feelings and needs, while respecting the rights of others.”
Once goals have been finalized, educators need to develop specific learning objectives that focus on what young people will learn from the lesson. Many educators find it helpful to think of learning objectives as falling into four basic categories. In a given lesson, students may acquire new knowledge, enhance thinking skills, develop psychomotor skills, or change attitudes, values, and/or feelings.8
The life behaviors listed for each key concept can help educators create broad outcome measures. Life behaviors are essentially outcomes of instruction that reflect actions students will be able to take after having applied the information and skills.
In addition, the developmental messages in the Guidelines can help educators create learning objectives for lessons on specific topics. For example, in Key Concept 3: Personal Skills, Topic 3 is Communication. An educator creating a lesson plan for middle school or junior high school students (Level 3) on communication might generate the following learning objectives using the Guidelines’ developmental messages:
By the end of this session:
•	Students will be able to identify three behaviors that can enhance communication.
•	Students will be able to identify three behaviors that can impair communication.
•	Students will be able to reflect on how verbal and nonverbal communication may have a different meaning depending on the individual, family, gender, cultural background, and situation.
Not all of the developmental messages in the Guidelines should or will become learning objectives. Educators and curriculum planners will once again have to prioritize the information and skills they want to convey to young people in their community. In addition, many of the developmental
100 • Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education
messages build on each other and educators may find that it is easier and more effective to cover a number of related messages in one learning objective.
Teaching Methods
The final step to creating a lesson plan involves deciding which teaching methods will work best for each topic. Again, this decision depends on the time and resources available, the comfort level of the educator, and the needs and abilities of the students in the course. SIECUS believes that sexuality education is most effective when young people not only receive information but are also given the opportunity to explore their own attitudes and values and to develop or strengthen social skills. A wide variety of teaching methods and activities can foster learning such as interactive discussions, role plays, demonstration, individual and group research, group exercises, and homework assignments.
Evaluation
Even when educators and curriculum planners have developed their own lessons, it is helpful to review these lessons once they are written to ensure that they cover the important topics and concepts, are accurate and age-appropriate, and do not rely on fear or shame. Educators will also want to make sure that the curriculum or lessons are based on theories and techniques that have been proven effective. (See the Evaluating Curricula section on page 84 for specific ideas on how to do this.)
